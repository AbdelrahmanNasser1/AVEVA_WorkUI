<h3 id="t601945" class="heading3">Resource Set Activity</h3>
<p class="subheading">Activity Description:</p>
<p class="paragraph">The Resource Set Activity is used in the Workflow Management workflow process design when the actor for executing the subsequent activity needs to be selected by another actor in the previous activity of the workflow. This activity displays a list of actors in the Work items list of the actor who will make the selection.</p>
<p class="subheading">Application Scenarios:</p>
<p class="paragraph">A typical application scenario could be a Technical Support Request Workflow Process, in which the support request needs to be assigned to the appropriate technical support person for action. The Resource Set activity can be used to allow a supervisor to assign the support request on the basis of some condition.</p>
<p class="subheading">Variables for Capturing Resource Details:</p>
<p class="paragraph">The details of the resource submitting the ResourceSet response can be accessed</p>
<p class="paragraph">by declaring a variable of type resource with the following syntax:</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">'^'+Action Name+'RespondingUser'</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">This variable stores the responded user information. If it is more than one user, it will retrieve the last user details.</p>
<p class="note"><strong class="notelabel">Note:</strong> For a single user, you can declare this variable as <b class="uicontrol">Resource</b> type. If the task is assigned to more than one user and to get all responded users information, then declare this variable as an array.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Variables for assigning queue system variable:</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">To assign queues instead of setting the queue through<b class="uicontrol"> Assign Queue</b> property, add a variable with a name prefixed by '^', with the following syntax:</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">&quot;^&quot;+ CurrentActivity.Name + &quot;_QueueVariable</strong>&quot;.</p>
<p class="paragraph">For example, if the activity name is 'Approval1' then declare the variable as ^Approval1_QueueVariable in the Start activity with the Type as String. Using the &quot;Update Variable&quot; activity, assign the queue-id (GUID) for this variable in the workflow.</p>
<p class="paragraph">To assign multiple queues, specify the queue-ids with semicolon (;) separator.<b class="uicontrol"> Skelta.HWS.Queue.QueueCollection</b> class can be used to retrieve queue information.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Variable for Queue Acting Users</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">You can declare an array type variable to get updated information about the name of the actor to whom an activity gets assigned from a queue.</p>
<p class="paragraph">In the Workflow Variables, define the variable in the following format:</p>
<p class="paragraph">^+CurrentActivityName+'QueueActingUsers' </p>
<p class="paragraph">Ex: ^HRFormQueueActingUsers</p>
<p class="paragraph">HRForm is the activity name.</p>
<p class="paragraph">For example, the value of the user who acts on the HRForm activity will be stored in the variable. The Approval1 task will be assigned to the same user.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Variable for storing timeout warning value</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">Suppose you want to store the timeout warning value for Task activity in your workflow. The naming convention for the system variable to be declared is</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">^&lt;ActivityName&gt;ResponseByWarningTimeout</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">The value returned by the variable will be in UTC format. For multiple user scenarios the highest timeout value calculated for a user will be available in the variable.</p>
<p class="note"><strong class="notelabel">Note:</strong> Multiple timeout warnings cannot be tracked using this feature.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Variables for capturing Comments</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">To capture the comments entered by an actor, add a variable with a name prefixed by '^', with the following syntax:</p>
<p class="paragraph">'^'+_WorkItem.HWSActivity.ActivityName+'Comments'</p>
<p class="paragraph">For example, if the activity name is 'ResourceSet1' then declare the variable as ^ ResourceSet1Comments in the Start activity.</p>
<p class="note"><strong class="notelabel">Note:</strong> By default, the comment field is not available in the &quot;ResourceSet&quot; activity.</p>
<p class="paragraph">To add a comment field to the ResourceSet activity, create a Textbox control named 'txtComment' in the 'ResourceSetUI.html' page which is available under (&quot;[AVEVA Work Tasks Installed Path]\WorkflowElements\Default\en-US\Activities\Activity folder&quot;).</p>
<p class="subheading">Activity Properties:</p>
<p class="paragraph">The Resource Set activity has to be configured by specifying appropriate values for the different properties in the Activity Properties area. The Activity Properties can be accessed by clicking on the Activity Properties tool in the Tool Bar or by selecting the appropriate option from the right-click menu for the Resource Set activity. The Activity Properties are organized under the following groups of related properties. The properties under each group are described in this topic.</p>

<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Assign Actor</strong>&nbsp;- This property allows you to select the workflow variable to which the actor will be set by the actor acting on the Resource Set. The variables will have to be created in the properties for the Start activity. The variables can be one of the three types - String, Array or Resource. String variables take one UserID at a time, while Arrays take in a number of UserIDs pointing to different actors. Resource variables will take the complete resource properties. In a group action scenario, where more than one actor acts on the Resource Set activity, the selection of the last actor to act will be assigned to the variable.</p>

<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Min. Ownerships [% or Number]</strong>&nbsp;- This property, which can be specified as a number or percentage, is the minimum number of actors who should take ownership of the Resource Set request. This property is related to the 'Timeout warning for Ownership' and 'Timeout for Ownership' properties. To illustrate, when 'Timeout for Ownership' is reached, the activity first checks if the ownership count is less than Min.Ownerships (if it is set). If it is, the work item will be removed from all Work items lists. If the 'Min.Ownerships' has already been satisfied, then the work item will be removed from the Work items lists of those who have not taken ownership. If the Min.Ownerships value is 0, then the activity checks if the ownership count is less than Max.Ownerships (if it is set). If it is, the work item will be removed from all Work items lists. Else the work item will be removed from the Work items lists of those who have not taken ownership. If both Min.Ownerships and Max.Ownerships are set to 0, then there should be at least one actor taking ownership within the set time, otherwise the work item will be removed from all Work items lists.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Property Type: Optional</strong>&nbsp;(This property needs to be set only if necessary. It is useful in group response scenarios.)</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Max. Ownerships [% or Number]</strong>&nbsp;- This property, which can be specified as a number or percentage, is the maximum number of actors who should take ownership of the Resource Set request. If 'Timeout for Ownership' is specified and achieved, and the 'Min.Ownerships' is also satisfied, then the activity waits for action from those who have taken ownership. If the Min.Ownerships value is set to 0, then it checks if the ownership count is less than Max.Ownerships. If it is, the work item will be removed from all Work items lists. Else the work item will be removed from the Work items lists of those who have not taken ownership. If both Min.Ownerships and Max.Ownerships are set to 0, then there should be at least one actor taking ownership within the set time, otherwise the work item will be removed from all Work items lists.</p>

<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Property Type: Optional</strong>&nbsp;(This property needs to be set only if necessary.)</p>
<p class="paragraph"><b class="uicontrol">Ignore Unavailable Actors?</b>&nbsp;- This property provides the following options -&nbsp;<b class="uicontrol">Yes</b>,&nbsp;<b class="uicontrol">Yes</b> - <b class="uicontrol">holidays excluded</b>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<b class="uicontrol">No</b>. If this property is set to 'No', when the Approval activity is assigned to the actor's Work items list, a check is first done to see whether the actor is available. If the actor is not available then a check is made for an alternate actor assigned to the unavailable actor. Simultaneously, the value of the property 'Alternate Actor Allowed' is checked. If that is also set, then the Approval work item is assigned to this actor. If this property is set to&nbsp;Yes - holidays excluded,&nbsp;the workflow engine will ignore the fact that actors are not available if the day is an organization holiday and the output Not Enough Resources will not be generated. </p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Property Type: Optional</strong>&nbsp;(This property needs to be set only if necessary.)</p>

<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Decision Influencers</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">The properties in the Decision Influencers group have been described below. You can use these properties to specify some parameters that influence the outcome of the activity.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><b class="uicontrol">Max Actors Required For ResourceSet Completion [% or Number]</b>&nbsp;- This property is used to check what percentage or number of actors should take action for Resource Set. Decision on the Resource Set is taken only after the specified number or percentage of actor(s) have taken the action. The activity waits for the actors' action until the 'Timeout for activity' is reached.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Property Type: Optional</strong>&nbsp;(This property needs to be set only if necessary. It is useful in group response scenarios.)</p>
<p class="paragraph"><b class="uicontrol">Min Actors Required For ResourceSet Completion [% or Number]</b>&nbsp;- This property specifies the minimum number of actors to act on the Resource Set before the 'Timeout Warning for Activity'. If the activity limit is reached before the 'Timeout Warning for Activity' then the warning message is not shown.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Property Type: Optional</strong>&nbsp;(This property needs to be set only if necessary. It is useful in group response scenarios.)</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Escalation &amp; Timeout</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">The properties in the Escalation &amp; Timeout group have been described below. You can use these properties to specify escalation and timeout settings for the activity.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><b class="uicontrol">Set Calendar for Timeout</b>&nbsp;- This property is used to specify the calendar to be used to determine activity timeouts.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Property Type: Optional</strong>&nbsp;(This property needs to be set only if necessary.)</p>
<p class="procedureheading">Steps to Set Calendar for Timeout</p>
<ol class="step"><li class="step">To specify the calendar for timeout, click the button for the 'Set Calendar for Timeout' property to open the property window.</li><li class="step">In this window select the required calendar by clicking the calendar name in the tree structure.</li><li class="step">Click&nbsp;<b class="uicontrol">Set Calendar</b>&nbsp;to set the selected calendar.</li><li class="step">You can specify that a resource calendar should be used, if available, by clicking to select the corresponding check box.</li></ol><p class="paragraph">See&nbsp;<a id="h194369" class="jump-currentwindowlive" title="ResourceSet - Set Calendar for Timeout" href="resourceset-setcalendarfortimeout.html" target="_self">ResourceSet - Set Calendar for Timeout</a> for Timeout&nbsp;for a detailed description of the Set Calendar for Timeout property window.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><b class="uicontrol">Minimum available time for Activity</b>&nbsp;- This property is used to check the availability of an actor to whom a task must be assigned while executing the activity. The availability check for the actor is done based on the Calendar settings (Global or Resource Calendar). If the time taken to complete the task is within the value set for the <b class="uicontrol">Minimum available time for Activity </b> property, then the task will be assigned to that actor. However, if the time taken to complete the task exceeds the value set for the <b class="uicontrol">Minimum available time for Activity</b> property, then the task will be assigned based on the values set for the <b class="uicontrol">Ignore Unavailable Actors?</b> and <b class="uicontrol">Alternate Actor Allowed?</b> properties.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Property Type: Optional</strong>&nbsp;(This property needs to be set only if necessary.)</p>
<p class="paragraph"><b class="uicontrol">Timeout warning for Ownership</b>&nbsp;- This property specifies the time at which a warning is provided to an actor to take ownership of the work item assigned to him/her. If the actor does not take ownership within this time, the engine is notified with a warning. Thus if 'Min.Ownerships' is set, and it is not satisfied before the given time then a warning is sent. If Min.Ownerships is 0, it will check for Max.Ownerships. If the ownership count does not reach the Max.Ownerships value within the set time, a warning is sent. If both Min.Ownerships and Max.Ownerships are not set, this property is ignored.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Property Type: Optional</strong>&nbsp;(This property needs to be set only if necessary.)</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Understand how Ownership Properties relate to each other:</strong></p>
<ul class="ulitem"><li class="ulitem">Resource Set activity is assigned to the actors in the Resource Set list by the workflow engine. Resource Set activity has a default property set that at least one actor has to make Take Ownership of the activity.</li><li class="ulitem">A drop-down interface has been provided for the resource to Take Ownership. However, the actor can act on the Resource Set without taking ownership first, in which case ownership will be considered to be done. i.e. if the actor acts upon the Resource Set activity without ownership, then it is considered as an ownership with action taken.</li><li class="ulitem">After the actor has taken ownership, a link is provided to the actor, which opens a pop up with the details of the other actors. This is again tagged with the 'Hide Responses?' property. The link will be provided only If 'Hide Responses?' is set as 'No'. The pop up will have details like Actor name, Ownership Status, Action taken, Comments.</li><li class="ulitem">If the 'Min.Ownerships' property is set and the ownership count has reached the set limit [percentage or number] then the 'Timeout Warning For Ownership' property is not considered.</li><li class="ulitem">If the 'Min.Ownerships' property is set and the ownership count has reached the set limit [percentage or number] and the 'Time Out For Ownership' is also reached then the work item is removed from other actors' Work items list and the work item waits for action from those who have taken ownership.</li><li class="ulitem">If the 'Min.Ownerships' limit is not reached for the Resource Set activity, and the 'Timeout Warning For Ownership' has been exceeded then the actor is notified with a warning by including an email or an information activity, with the Timeout Warning for Ownership link to it.</li><li class="ulitem">If 'Timeout For Ownership' is set, if the Resource Set activity has not reached the minimum limit (Min.Ownerships) and the 'Time Out For Ownership' has been reached, then the work item is removed from the Work items lists of all the actors.</li><li class="ulitem">If 'Min.Ownerships' = 0 and if 'Max.Ownerships' is set, the activity waits for actors to take ownership or action until the 'Time Out For Ownership' is reached (if this is set).</li><li class="ulitem">If none of the Ownership properties are set then the activity waits until the actor takes ownership or acts upon it.</li></ul><p class="paragraph"><b class="uicontrol">Timeout for Ownership</b>&nbsp;- This property specifies the time until which actors are allowed to take ownership, i.e. the time until which the Resource Set action will wait for actors to take ownership. If Min.Ownerships is set and is not reached, the work item is removed from all Work items lists. If Min.Ownerships is 0, it will check if ownership count is less than Max.Ownerships. If it is, the work item is removed from all Work items lists. Else the work item will be removed from the Work items lists of those who have not taken ownership. The work item will remain in the Work items list of those who have taken ownership and wait for action from them.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Property Type: Optional</strong>&nbsp;(This property needs to be set only if necessary.)</p>
<p class="paragraph"><b class="uicontrol">Timeout warning for Activity</b>&nbsp;- This property specifies when a reminder has to be provided for the actors to act on the Resource Set request, if the action count has not been reached. If properties such as Max.Ownerships, Affirmative Action for Resource Set (AAA), and Action Limit (AL) are set, once the property values are reached then a warning is sent to the actor. When the timeout is reached, the following checks are made: If AL is set, when the action count i.e. the no. of Resource Sets (AC) &lt; AL, then a warning is sent. If AL = 0 and AAA is set, and when AC &lt; AAA, then a warning is sent to the actor.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Property Type: Optional</strong>&nbsp;(This property needs to be set only if necessary. It is useful in setting escalations.)</p>
<p class="paragraph"><b class="uicontrol">Timeout for Activity</b>&nbsp;- This property's value is used to decide until what time the activity should wait for the actors' action. If properties such as Max.Ownerships, AAA, AL are set, once the property values are reached the work item is removed from the Work Item lists of all the actors. When the timeout is reached, the following checks are made: If AL is set, when the action count i.e. the no. of Resource Sets or rejections (AC) &lt; AL, then the timeout for action is performed and the work item is removed from all Work items lists. If AC &gt; AL, it checks with the no. of Resource Sets or 'decision count' (DC) and AAA. If DC &gt;= AAA (if it is set), the action is considered completed. If AAA = 0 and if DC &gt;= AL, the action is considered completed. If AL = 0 and AC &lt; AAA, then the timeout for action is performed and the activity is removed from all activity lists. If AL = 0 and AC &gt; AAA, it will check with DC. If DC &gt; AAA it is completed. If AL = 0 and AAA = 0, then if DC is at least 1, then it is considered completed.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Property Type: Optional</strong>&nbsp;(This property needs to be set only if necessary. It is useful in setting escalations.)</p>
<p class="paragraph"><b class="uicontrol">Multiple Timeout Warning</b>&nbsp;- This is used to set recurring timeout warnings that will be sent to the actors who have to take action. To set multiple timeout warnings, click the 'Multiple TimeOut Warning' button in the Properties pane for the Resource Set activity. A new window pops up. In this window, set the interval for the recurring warning as well as the output message. You can also set the Recurring Time Interval. This can be used to set a different recurring time out after the first timeout happens. For example, if 'Time Interval' for the property is set as 7 days and 'Recurring Time Interval' is set as 2 days, then the first time out will happen after 7 days and there will be a recurring time out every second day after the seventh day (first) time out.</p>
