<h3 id="t601935" class="heading3">Approval Activity</h3>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Activity Description</strong>:</p>
<p class="paragraph">The Approval Action is used in the Workflow Management Workflow process design in cases where an approval request has to be approved by an actor or set of actors.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Application Scenarios</strong>:</p>
<p class="paragraph">Typical application scenarios include the Leave Approval Workflow Process, which will have an Approval activity by a Manager, and the Purchase Requisition Workflow, which will have an Approval activity by an Accounts Manager.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Workflow Variables for Approval:</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Steps to define variables for use in the Approval activity:</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">This section describes how to define variables for use in Approval activities. It gives the syntax for creating the variables and typical examples for different cases.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Variables for capturing WorkItemIds</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">The Activityids for the activity can be retrieved using a variable of type array, with the following syntax:</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">'^'+CurrentActivity.Name+'WorkItemIds'</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">For example, ^ManagerApprovalWorkItemIds</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Variables for capturing All Actors' Details</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">The details of the actor(s) to whom the approval work item gets assigned can be accessed by declaring a variable of type array with the following syntax:</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">'^'+CurrentActivity.Name+'ActingUsers'</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">For example, <strong class="strong">^ManagerApprovalActingUsers</strong>.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Variables for capturing Responding Actors' Details</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">The details of the actor submitting the approval/rejection response can be accessed by declaring a variable of type resource with the following syntax:</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">'^'+HWSActivity.ActivityName+'RespondingUser'</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">For example, ^ManagerApprovalRespondingUser.</p>
<p class="paragraph">This variable stores the responded user information. In case of multiple users, it will retrieve the last user details.</p>
<p class="note"><strong class="notelabel">Note:</strong> For single user, you can declare this variable as Resource type. If task is assigned to multiple users, to get all responded users information, then declare this variable as <b class="uicontrol">Array</b>. </p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Variables for capturing Approving/Rejecting Actor Details</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">The details of the actor(s) submitting either approval or rejection response can be accessed by declaring a variable of type Array with the following syntax:</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">'^'+ activityName+'ApprovingUsers' (or)</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">'^'+ activityName+'RejectingUsers'</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">For example, <strong class="strong">^ManagerApprovalApprovingUsers or ^ManagerApprovalRejectingUsers</strong>.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Variables for capturing Comments</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">To capture the comments entered by an actor, add a variable with a name prefixed by '^', with the following syntax:</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">'^'+_WorkItem.HWSActivity.ActivityName+'CommentApproved'/'CommentRejected'</strong>.</p>
<p class="paragraph">For example, if a comment entered along with an approval submission has to be retrieved from an activity named 'ManagerApproval', add a variable with <strong class="strong">^ManagerApprovalCommentApproved</strong> as its name. If a comment entered along with a rejection submission has to be retrieved from the same activity, i.e., 'ManagerApproval', add a variable with ^ManagerApprovalCommentRejected as its name. The variable gets initialized with the comment entered by the actor, after the activity response is submitted.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Variables for assigning queue system variable</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">To assign queues instead of setting the queue through Assign Queue property, add a variable with a name prefixed by '^', with the following syntax:</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">&quot;^&quot;+ CurrentActivity.Name + &quot;_QueueVariable&quot;.</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">For example, if the activity name is 'Approval1' then declare the variable as ^Approval1_QueueVariable in the Start activity with the Type as String. Using the &quot;Update Variable&quot; activity, assign the queue-id (GUID) for this variable in the workflow.</p>
<p class="paragraph">To assign multiple queues, specify the queue-ids with semicolon (;) as a separator. <strong class="strong">Skelta.HWS.Queue.QueueCollection</strong> class can be used to retrieve queue information.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Variable for Queue Acting Users</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">You can declare an Array type variable to get updated information about the name of the actor to whom an activity gets assigned from a queue.</p>
<p class="paragraph">In the Workflow Variables, define the variable in the following format:</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">^+CurrentActivityName+'QueueActingUsers'</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">Ex: ^HRFormQueueActingUsers</p>
<p class="paragraph">HRForm is the activity name.</p>
<p class="paragraph">For example the value of the user who acts on the HRForm activity will be stored in the variable. The Approval1 task will be assigned to the same user.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Variable for storing timeout warning value</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">Suppose if you want to store the timeout warning value for an Approval activity in your workflow. The naming convention for the system variable to be declared is:</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">^&lt;ActivityName&gt;ResponseByWarningTimeout</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">The value returned by the variable will be in UTC format. For multiple user scenarios the highest timeout value calculated for a user will be available in the variable.</p>
<p class="note"><strong class="notelabel">Note:</strong>Multiple timeout warnings cannot be tracked using this feature.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Every time you input a value for a property, ensure to save the data. Click the <b class="uicontrol">Save</b> button on the <b class="uicontrol">Activity Properties</b> window. You need to save the property so that the subsequent properties in the activity can inherit the required information.</p>
<p class="paragraph"></p>
<p class="paragraph"></p>
<p class="subheading"><strong class="strong">Activity Properties:</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">The <b class="uicontrol">Approval</b> activity has to be configured by specifying appropriate values for the different properties in the Action Properties area. The Activity Properties can be accessed by clicking on the Activity Properties tool in the Tool Bar or by selecting the appropriate option from the right click menu for the Approval activity. The Activity Properties are organized under the following groups of related properties. The properties under each group are described in this topic.</p>

<p class="paragraph"><b class="uicontrol">Timeout Warning for Activity</b> - This property specifies when a reminder has to be provided for the approvers to act on the Approval request, if the activity count has not been reached. If properties such as Max.Ownerships, Affirmative Answer for Approval (AAA), and Action Limit (AL) are set, once the property values are reached then a warning is sent to the actor. When the timeout is reached, the following checks are made: If AL is set, when the activity count i.e. the no. of approvals or rejections (AC) &lt; AL, then a warning is sent; if AL = 0 and AAA is set, and when AC &lt; AAA, then a warning is sent to the participant. </p>
