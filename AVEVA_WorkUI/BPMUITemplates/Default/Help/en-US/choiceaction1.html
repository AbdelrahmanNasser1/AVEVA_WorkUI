<h3 id="t601940" class="heading3">Choice Activity</h3>
<p class="subheading">Activity Description:</p>
<p class="paragraph">The Choice Activity is used in the AVEVA Work Tasks workflow process design in cases where a task needs to be assigned with multiple options for an action. This activity can be configured with buttons, with the provision to set the output of each as task completion makers. A maximum of ten such buttons can be configured.</p>
<p class="subheading">Application Scenarios:</p>
<p class="paragraph">To illustrate the functionality of the Choice activity, consider a scenario in which the approval activity in a process requires a provision to send back the approval request in addition to the standard responses of approval and rejection. In this case, the Choice activity can be used to create a customized approval activity with an additional button named 'Send back' in addition to the 'Approve' and 'Reject' buttons. Without this activity, a custom activity would have to be created to achieve this functionality.</p>
<p class="subheading">Workflow Variables for Choice:</p>
<p class="procedureheading">Steps to define variables for use in the Choice activity</p>
<p class="paragraph">This section describes how to define variables for use in Choice activities. It gives the syntax for creating the variables and typical examples for different cases.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Variables for capturing WorkItemIds</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">The Work Item Id's for the Choice work item can be retrieved using a variable of type array, with the following syntax:</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">'^'+CurrentActivity.Name+'WorkItemIds'.</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">For example, <strong class="strong">^CandidateApprovalWorkItemIds</strong>.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Variables for capturing All Actors' Details</p>
<p class="paragraph">The details of the actor(s) to whom the Choice work item gets assigned can be accessed by declaring a variable of type array with the following syntax:</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">'^'+CurrentActivity.Name+'ActingUsers'</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">For example, <strong class="strong">^CandidateApprovalActingUsers</strong>.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Variables for capturing Responding Actors' Details</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">The details of the actors' responding to the Choice work item can be accessed by declaring a variable of type resource with the following syntax:</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">'^'+HWSActivity.ActivityName+'RespondingUser'</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">For example,<strong class="strong"> ^CandidateApprovalRespondingUser.</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">This variable stores the responded user information. If it is more than one user, it will retrieve the last user details.</p>
<p class="note"><strong class="notelabel">Note:</strong> For single user, you can declare this variable as <b class="uicontrol">Resource</b> type. If task is assigned to more than one user and to get all responded users information, then declare this variable as array.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><b class="uicontrol">Variables for capturing Comments</b></p>
<p class="paragraph">Comments entered in a Choice work item can be retrieved</p>
<p class="paragraph">using a variable with the following syntax:</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">'^'+_HWSActivity.ActivityName+'CommentChoiceStatus'.</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">For example, <strong class="strong">^CandidateApprovalCommentChoiceStatus</strong>.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Variables for assigning queue system variable</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">To assign queues instead of setting the queue through Assign Queue property, add a variable with a name prefixed by '^', with the following syntax:</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">&quot;^&quot;+ CurrentActivity.Name + &quot;_QueueVariable&quot;.</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">For example, if the activity name is 'Approval1' then declare the variable as ^Approval1_QueueVariable in the Start activity with the Type as String. Using the &quot;Update Variable&quot; activity, assign the queue-id (GUID) for this variable in the workflow.</p>
<p class="paragraph">To assign multiple queues, specify the queue-ids with semicolon (;) separator. Skelta.HWS.Queue.QueueCollection class can be used to retrieve queue information.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Variable for Queue Acting Users</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">You can declare an array type variable to get updated information about the name of the actor to whom an activity gets assigned from a queue.</p>
<p class="paragraph">In the Workflow Variables, define the variable in the following format:</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">^+CurrentActivityName+'QueueActingUsers'</strong> </p>
<p class="paragraph">Ex: ^HRFormQueueActingUsers</p>
<p class="paragraph">HRForm is the activity name.</p>
<p class="paragraph">For example, the value of the user who acts on the HRForm activity will be stored in the variable. The Approval1 task will be assigned to the same user.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Variable for storing timeout warning value</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">Suppose if you want to store the timeout warning value for Choice activity in your workflow. The naming convention for the system variable to be declared is</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">^&lt;ActivityName&gt;ResponseByWarningTimeout</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">The value returned by the variable will be in UTC format. For multiple user scenarios the highest timeout value calculated for a user will be available in the variable.</p>
<p class="note"><strong class="notelabel">Note:</strong> Multiple timeout warnings cannot be tracked using this feature.</p>
<p class="subheading">Activity Properties:</p>
<p class="paragraph">The <b class="uicontrol">Choice</b> activity has to be configured by specifying appropriate values for the different properties in the Activity Properties area. The Activity Properties can be accessed by clicking on the Activity Properties tool in the Tool Bar or by selecting the appropriate option from the right-click menu for the Choice activity. The Activity Properties are organized under the following groups of related properties. The properties under each group are described in this topic.</p>

<p class="paragraph"><b class="uicontrol">Min. Ownerships [% or Number]</b> - This property, which can be specified as a number or percentage, is the minimum number of actors who should take ownership of the Choice request. This property is related to the 'Timeout warning for Ownership' and 'Timeout for Ownership' properties. To illustrate, when 'Timeout for Ownership' is reached, the activity first checks if the ownership count is less than Min.Ownerships (if it is set). If it is, the work item will be removed from all Work items lists. If the 'Min.Ownerships' has already been satisfied, then the work item will be removed from the Work items lists of those who have not taken ownership. If the Min.Ownerships value is 0, then the activity checks if the ownership count is less than Max.Ownerships (if it is set). If it is, the work item will be removed from all Work items lists. Else the work item will be removed from the Work items lists of those who have not taken ownership. If both Min.Ownerships and Max.Ownerships are set to 0, then there should be at least one actor taking ownership within the set time, otherwise the work item will be removed from all Work items lists.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Property Type: Optional</strong> (This property needs to be set only if necessary. It is useful in group response scenarios.)</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Max.

If 'Timeout for Ownerships' is specified and achieved, and the 'Min.Ownerships' is also satisfied, then the activity waits for action from those who have taken ownership. If the Min.Ownerships value is set to 0, then it checks if the ownership count is less than Max.Ownerships. If it is, the work item will be removed from all Work items lists. Else the work item will be removed from the Work items lists of those who have not taken ownership. If both Min.Ownerships and Max.Ownerships are set to 0, then there should be at least one actor taking ownership within the set time, otherwise the work item will be removed from all Work items lists.</p>

<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Property Type: Optional</strong> (This property needs to be set only if necessary.)</p>
<p class="paragraph"><b class="uicontrol">Ignore Unavailable Actors?</b> - This property provides the following options - <b class="uicontrol">Yes</b>, <b class="uicontrol">Yes</b> - holidays excluded and No. If this property is set to 'No', when the Approval activity is assigned to the actor's Work item list, a check is first done to see whether the actor is available. If the actor is not available then a check is made for an alternate actor assigned to the unavailable actor. Simultaneously the value of the property 'Alternate Actor Allowed' is checked. If that is also set, then the Approval work item is assigned to this actor. If this property is set to <b class="uicontrol">Yes</b> - <b class="uicontrol">holidays excluded</b>, the workflow engine will ignore the fact that actors are not available if the day is an organization holiday and the output Not Enough Resources will not be generated. </p>

<p class="paragraph"><b class="uicontrol">Timeout warning for Activity</b> - This property specifies when a reminder has to be provided for the actors to act on the Choice request, if the action count has not been reached. If properties such as Max.Ownerships, Affirmative Action for Choice (AAA), and Action Limit (AL) are set, once the property values are reached then a warning is sent to the actor. When the timeout is reached, the following checks are made: if AL is set, when the action count i.e. the no. of Choices or rejections (AC) &lt; AL, then a warning is sent, if AL = 0 and AAA is set, and when AC &lt; AAA, then a warning is sent to the actor. </p>

If properties such as Max.Ownerships, AAA, AL are set, once the property values are reached the work item is removed from the Work Item lists of all the actors. When the timeout is reached, the following checks are made: If AL is set, when the action count i.e. the no. of Choices or rejections (AC) &lt; AL, then the timeout for action is performed and the activity is removed from all Work Item lists. If AC &gt; AL, it checks with the no. of Choices or 'decision count' (DC) and AAA. If DC &gt;= AAA (if it is set), the activity is considered approved; otherwise, it is rejected. If AAA = 0 and if DC &gt;= AL, the activity is considered approved; otherwise, it is rejected. If AL = 0 and AC &lt; AAA, then the timeout for action is performed and the work item is removed from all Work Item lists. If AL = 0 and AC &gt; AAA, it will check with DC. If DC &gt; AAA it is approved; otherwise, it is rejected. If AL = 0 and AAA = 0, then if DC is at least 1, then it is considered approved; otherwise, it is rejected. </p>
