<h3 id="t601947" class="heading3">Task Activity</h3>
<p class="subheading">Activity Description:</p>
<p class="paragraph">The Task Activity is used in a Workflow Management workflow process design in order to assign a task to an actor or set of actors. This activity is used to define the task type and the associated status.</p>
<p class="subheading">Application Scenarios:</p>
<p class="paragraph">A typical application scenario could be a Bug Tracking Workflow Process, in which bug fixing tasks will be assigned to developers. The task can have a drop-down that will function as a task completion maker. From the drop-down, the developer can select the status of the task, selecting &quot;Closed&quot; when the bug is fixed.</p>
<p class="subheading">Workflow Variables for Task:</p>
<p class="procedureheading">Steps to define variables for use in the Task activity</p>
<p class="paragraph">This section describes how to define variables for use in Task activities. It gives the syntax for creating the variables and typical examples for different cases.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Variables for capturing WorkItemIds</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">The Activityids for the Task work item can be retrieved using a variable of type array, with the following syntax:</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">'^'+CurrentActivity.Name+'WorkItemIds'.</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">For example, <strong class="strong">^SolveNetworkIssueWorkItemIds</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Variables for capturing All Actors' Details</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">The details of the actor(s) to whom the Task work item gets assigned can be accessed by declaring a variable of type array with the following syntax:</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">'^'+CurrentActivity.Name+'ActingUsers'</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">For example, <strong class="strong">^SolveNetworkIssueActingUsers.</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">Variables for capturing Responding Actor Details</p>
<p class="paragraph">The details of the actor submitting the Task response can be accessed by declaring a variable of type actor with the following syntax:</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">'^'+HWSActivity.ActivityName+'RespondingUser'</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">For example,<strong class="strong"> ^SolveNetworkIssueRespondingUser</strong>.</p>
<p class="paragraph">This variable stores the responded user information. If it is more than one user, it will retrieve the last user details.</p>
<p class="note"><strong class="notelabel">Note:</strong> For single user, you can declare this variable as Resource type. If task is assigned to more than one user and to get all responded users information, then declare this variable as array.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Variables for capturing Comments</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">Comments entered in a Task can be retrieved using a variable with the following syntax:</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">'^'+_HWSActivity.ActivityName+'CommentTaskStatus'</strong>.</p>
<p class="paragraph">For example, if a comment entered along with a task response submission has to be retrieved from an activity named 'SolveNetworkIssue', add a variable with ^SolveNetworkIssueCommentTaskStatus as its name. The variable gets initialized with the comment entered by the resource after the activity submission.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Variables for assigning queue system variable</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">To assign queues instead of setting the queue through Assign Queue property, add a variable with a name prefixed by '^', with the following syntax:</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">&quot;^&quot;+ CurrentActivity.Name + &quot;_QueueVariable&quot;.</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">For example, if the activity name is 'Approval1' then declare the variable as ^Approval1_QueueVariable in the Start activity with the Type as String. Using the &quot;Update Variable&quot; activity, assign the queue-id (GUID) for this variable in the workflow.</p>
<p class="paragraph">To assign multiple queues, specify the queue-ids with semicolon (;) separator. Skelta.HWS.Queue.QueueCollection class can be used to retrieve queue information.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Variable for Queue Acting Users</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">You can declare an array type variable to get updated information about the name of the actor to whom an activity gets assigned from a queue.</p>
<p class="paragraph">In the Workflow Variables, define the variable in the following format:</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">^+CurrentActivityName+'QueueActingUsers'</strong> </p>
<p class="paragraph">Ex: <strong class="strong">^HRFormQueueActingUsers</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">HRForm is the activity name.</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">For example, the value of the user who acts on the HRForm activity will be stored in the variable. The Approval1 task will be assigned to the same user.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Variables for storing timeout warning value</p>
<p class="paragraph">Suppose, you want to store the timeout warning value for a task activity in your workflow. The naming convention for the system variable to be declared is</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">^&lt;ActivityName&gt;ResponseByWarningTimeout</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">The value returned by the variable will be in UTC format. For multiple user scenarios the highest timeout value calculated for a user will be available in the variable.</p>
<p class="subheading"></p>
<p class="subheading"></p>
<p class="subheading">Activity Properties:</p>
<p class="paragraph">The Task activity has to be configured by specifying appropriate values for the different properties in the Activity Properties area. The Activity Properties can be accessed by clicking on the Activity Properties tool in the Tool Bar or by selecting the appropriate option from the right-click menu for the Task activity. The Activity Properties are organized under the following groups of related properties. The properties under each group are described in this topic.</p>

<p class="paragraph"><b class="uicontrol">Min. Ownerships [% or Number]</b>&nbsp;- This property, which can be specified as a number or percentage, is the minimum number of actors who should take ownership of the Task assignment. This property is related to the 'Timeout warning for Ownership' and 'Timeout for Ownership' properties. To illustrate, when 'Timeout for Ownership' is reached, the activity first checks if the ownership count is less than Min.Ownerships (if it is set). If it is, the work item will be removed from all Work Item lists. </p>
<p class="paragraph">If the 'Min.Ownerships' has already been satisfied, then the work item will be removed from the Work Item lists of those who have not taken ownership. If the Min.Ownerships value is 0, then the activity checks if the ownership count is less than Max.Ownerships (if it is set). If it is, the work item will be removed from all Work Item lists. Else, the work item will be removed from the Work Item lists of those who have not taken ownership. If both Min.Ownerships and Max.Ownerships are set to 0, then there should be at least one actor taking ownership within the set time, otherwise the work item will be removed from all Work Item lists. </p>

<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Max. Ownerships [% or Number]</strong>&nbsp;- This property, which can be specified as a number or percentage, is the maximum number of actors who should take ownership of the Task assignment. If 'Timeout for Ownership' is specified and achieved, and the 'Min.Ownerships' is also satisfied, then the activity waits for action from those who have taken ownership. If the Min.Ownerships value is set to 0, then it checks if the ownership count is less than Max.Ownerships. If it is, the work item will be removed from all Work Item lists. Else the work item will be removed from the Work Item list of those who have not taken ownership. If both Min.Ownerships and Max.Ownerships are set to 0, then there should be at least one actor taking ownership within the set time, otherwise the work item will be removed from all Work Item lists. </p>

If this property is set to 'No', when the Approval activity is assigned to the actor's Work Item list, a check is first done to see whether the actor is available. If the actor is not available then a check is made for an alternate actor assigned to the unavailable actor. Simultaneously, the value of the property 'Alternate Actor Allowed' is checked. If that is also set, then the Approval work item is assigned to this actor. If this property is set to&nbsp;Yes - holidays excluded,&nbsp;the workflow engine will ignore the fact that actors are not available if the day is an organization holiday and the output Not Enough Resources will not be generated.   </p>

<p class="paragraph"><b class="uicontrol">Minimum available time for Activity</b>&nbsp;- This property is used to check the availability of an actor to whom a task must be assigned while executing the activity. The availability check for the actor is done based on the Calendar settings (Global or Resource Calendar). If the time taken to complete the task is within the value set for the <b class="uicontrol">Minimum available time for Activity </b> property, then the task will be assigned to that actor.

If the actor does not take ownership within this time the engine is notified with a warning. Thus if 'Min.Ownerships' is set, and it is not satisfied before the given time then a warning is sent. If Min.Ownerships is 0, it will check for Max.Ownerships. If the ownerships count does not reach the Max.Ownerships value within the set time, a warning is sent. If both Min.Ownerships and Max.Ownerships are not set, this property is ignored.</p>

However, the actor can act on the Task without taking ownership first, in which case ownership will be considered to be done. i.e. if the actor acts upon the Task activity without taking ownership, then it is considered as an ownership with action taken.</li><li class="ulitem">After the actor has taken ownership, a link is provided to the actor, which opens a pop up with the details of the other actors. This is again tagged with the 'Hide Responses?' property. The link will be provided only If 'Hide Responses?' is set as 'No'. The pop up will have details like Actor name, Ownership Status, Action taken, Comments.</li><li class="ulitem">If the 'Min.Ownerships' property is set and the ownership count has reached the set limit [percentage or number] then the 'Timeout Warning For Ownership' property is not considered.</li><li class="ulitem">If the 'Min.Ownerships' property is set and the ownership count has reached the set limit [percentage or number] and the 'Time Out For Ownership' is also reached then the work item is removed from other actors' Work Item list and the work item waits for action from those who have taken ownership.</li><li class="ulitem">If the 'Min.Ownerships' limit is not reached for the Task activity, and the 'Timeout Warning For Ownership' has been exceeded then the actor is notified with a warning by including an email or an information activity, with the Timeout Warning for Ownership link to it.</li><li class="ulitem">If 'Timeout For Ownership' is set, if the Task activity has not reached the minimum limit (Min.Ownerships) and the 'Time Out For Ownership' has been reached, then the work item is removed from the Work Item lists of all the actors.</li><li class="ulitem">If 'Min.Ownerships' = 0 and if 'Max.Ownerships' is set, the activity waits for actors to take ownership or action until the 'Time Out For Ownership' is reached (if this is set).</li><li class="ulitem">If none of the Ownership properties are set then the activity waits until the actor takes ownership or acts upon it.</li></ul><p class="paragraph"></p>
<p class="paragraph"><b class="uicontrol">Timeout for Ownership</b>&nbsp;- This property specifies the time until which actors are allowed to take ownership, i.e. the time until which the Task activity will wait for actors to take ownership. If Min.Ownerships is set and is not reached, the work item is removed from all Work Item lists. If Min.Ownerships is 0, it will check if ownership count is less than Max.Ownerships. If it is, the work item is removed from all Work Item lists. Else the work item will be removed from the Work Item lists of those who have not taken ownership. The work item will remain in the Work Item list of actors who have taken ownership and wait for action from them.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Property Type: Optional</strong>&nbsp;(This property needs to be set only if necessary.)</p>
<p class="paragraph"><b class="uicontrol">Timeout Warning for Activity</b>&nbsp;- This property specifies when a reminder has to be provided for the actors to act on the Task request, if the action count has not been reached. If properties such as Max.Ownerships, Affirmative Action for Task (AAA), and Action Limit (AL) are set, once the property values are reached then a warning is sent to the participant. When the timeout is reached, the following checks are made: if AL is set, when the action count i.e. the no. of Tasks or rejections (AC) &lt; AL, then a warning is sent, if AL = 0 and AAA is set, and when AC &lt; AAA, then a warning is sent to the participant.</p>

<p class="paragraph"><b class="uicontrol">Timeout for Activity</b>&nbsp;- This property's value is used to decide until what time the activity should wait for the actors' action. If properties such as Max.Ownerships, AAA, AL are set, once the property values are reached the work item is removed from the Work Item lists of all the actors. When the timeout is reached, the following checks are made: If AL is set, when the action count i.e. the no. of Tasks or rejections (AC) &lt; AL, then the timeout for action is performed and the work item is removed from all Work Item lists. If AC &gt; AL, it checks with the no. of Tasks or 'decision count' (DC) and AAA. If DC &gt;= AAA (if it is set), the action is considered completed. If AAA = 0 and if DC &gt;= AL, the action is considered completed. If AL = 0 and AC &lt; AAA, then the timeout for action is performed and the activity is removed from all Work Item lists. If AL = 0 and AC &gt; AAA, it will check with DC. If DC &gt; AAA it is completed. If AL = 0 and AAA = 0, then if DC is at least 1, then it is considered completed.</p>

<p class="paragraph"><b class="uicontrol">Multiple Timeout Warning</b>&nbsp;- This is used to set recurring timeout warnings that will be sent to the actors who have to take action. To set multiple timeout warnings, click the 'Multiple TimeOut Warning' button in the Properties pane for the Task activity. A new window pops up. In this window, set the interval for the recurring warning as well as the output message. You can also set the Recurring Time Interval. This can be used to set a different recurring time out after the first timeout happens. For example, if 'Time Interval' for the property is set as 7 days and 'Recurring Time Interval' is set as 2 days, then the first time out will happen after 7 days and there will be a recurring time out every second day after the seventh day (first) time out.</p>
