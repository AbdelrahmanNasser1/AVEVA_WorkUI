<h3 id="t613024" class="heading3">Work Activity</h3>
<p class="subheading"><strong class="strong">Activity Description:</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">The Work Activity is used in the AVEVA Work Tasks workflow process design in cases where custom activities are required. This activity can be configured using XML configuration files and HTML templates allowing a high degree of flexibility in defining its functionality.</p>
<p class="paragraph">These configuration files are located in the [AVEVA Work Tasks Installed Path]\WorkflowElements\Default\en-US\Actions\WorkAction folder. The Work activity can be configured with Action Outputs, Input Variables, and Output Variables.</p>
<p class="paragraph"></p>
<p class="subheading"><strong class="strong">Application Scenarios:</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">A typical application scenario would be a Performance Appraisal Workflow where different user-interfaces will have to be shown to evaluators and those being evaluated. The Work activity with its role-based user-interfaces will help implement this functionality.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Workflow Variables for Work:</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Steps to define variables for use in the Work activity</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">This section describes how to define variables for use in Work activities. It gives the syntax for creating the variables and typical examples for different cases.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Variables for capturing WorkItemIds</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">The Work Item Id's for the Work work item can be retrieved using a variable of type array, with the following syntax:</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">'^'+CurrentActivity.Name+'WorkItemIds'.</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">For example, <strong class="strong">^WorkActivityWorkItemIds.</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Variables for capturing All Actors' Details</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">The details of the actor(s) to whom the Work work item gets assigned can be accessed by declaring a variable of type array with the following syntax:</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">'^'+CurrentActivity.Name+'ActingUsers'</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">For example, ^WorkActivityActingUsers.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Variables for capturing Responding Actors' Details</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">The details of the actors' responding to the Work work item can be accessed by declaring a variable of type resource with the following syntax:</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">'^'+HWSActivity.ActivityName+'RespondingUser'</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">For example, ^WorkActivityRespondingUser.</p>
<p class="paragraph">This variable stores the responded user information. If it is more than one user, it will retrieve the last user details.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Note: For a single user, you can declare this variable as Resource type. If task is assigned to more than one user and to get all responded users information, then declare this variable as array.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Variables for capturing Comments</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">Comments entered in a Work work item can be retrieved using a variable with the following syntax:</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">'^'+_WorkItem.CurrentActivity.Name+'CommentWork'</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">For example, <strong class="strong">^WorkActivityCommentWork.</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Variables for assigning queue system variable</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">To assign queues instead of setting the queue through Assign Queue property, add a variable with a name prefixed by '^', with the following syntax:</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">&quot;^&quot;+ CurrentActivity.Name + &quot;_QueueVariable&quot;.</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">For example, if the activity name is 'Approval1' then declare the variable as ^Approval1_QueueVariable in the Start activity with the Type as String. Using the &quot;Update Variable&quot; activity, assign the queue-id (GUID) for this variable in the workflow.</p>
<p class="paragraph">To assign multiple queues, specify the queue-ids with semicolon (;) separator. Skelta.HWS.Queue.QueueCollection class can be used to retrieve queue information.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Variable for Queue Acting Users</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">You can declare an array type variable to get updated information about the name of the actor to whom an activity gets assigned from a queue.</p>
<p class="paragraph">In the Workflow Variables, define the variable in the following format:</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">^+CurrentActivityName+'QueueActingUsers'</strong> </p>
<p class="paragraph">Ex: ^HRFormQueueActingUsers</p>
<p class="paragraph">HRForm is the activity name.</p>
<p class="paragraph">For example the value of the user who acts on the HRForm activity will be stored in the variable. The Approval1 task will be assigned to the same user.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Variable for storing timeout warning value</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">Suppose if you want to store the timeout warning value for Work activity in your workflow. The naming convention for the system variable to be declared is</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">^&lt;ActivityName&gt;ResponseByWarningTimeout</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">The value returned by the variable will be in UTC format. For multiple user scenarios the highest timeout value calculated for a user will be available in the variable.</p>
<p class="note"><strong class="notelabel">Note:</strong> Multiple timeout warnings cannot be tracked using this feature.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Activity Properties:</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">The Work activity has to be configured by specifying appropriate values for the different properties in the Activity Properties area. The Activity Properties can be accessed by clicking on the Activity Properties tool in the Tool Bar or by selecting the appropriate option from the right click menu for the Work activity. The Activity Properties are organized under the following groups of related properties. The properties under each group are described in this topic.</p>

<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Min. Ownerships [% or Number]</strong>&nbsp;- This property, which can be specified as a number or percentage, is the minimum number of actors who should take ownership of the Work assignment. This property is related to the 'Timeout warning for Ownership' and 'Timeout for Ownership' properties. To illustrate, when 'Timeout for Ownership' is reached, the activity first checks if the ownership count is less than Min.Ownerships (if it is set). If it is, the work item will be removed from all Work Item lists. If the 'Min.Ownerships' has already been satisfied, then the work item will be removed from the Work Item lists of those who have not taken ownership. If the Min.Ownerships value is 0, then the activity checks if the ownership count is less than Max.Ownerships (if it is set). If it is, the work item will be removed from all Work Item lists. Else the work item will be removed from the Work Item lists of those who have not taken ownership. If both Min.Ownerships and Max.Ownerships are set to 0, then there should be at least one actor taking ownership within the set time, otherwise the work item will be removed from all Work Item lists. </p>

If the Min.Ownerships value is set to 0, then it checks if the ownership count is less than</p>
<p class="paragraph">Max.Ownerships. If it is, the work item will be removed from all Work Item lists. Else the work item will be removed from the Work Item lists of those who have not taken ownership. If both Min.Ownerships and Max.Ownerships are set to 0, then there should be at least one actor taking ownership within the set time, otherwise the work item will be removed from all Work Item lists.

<p class="paragraph">The properties in the Decision Influencers group have been described below. You can use these properties to specify some parameters that influence the outcome of the activity.</p>
<p class="paragraph"></p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Max Actors Required for WorkAssignment Completion [% or Number]&nbsp;</strong>- This property is used to check what percentage or number of actors should take an action for Work. Decision on the Work is taken only after the specified number or percentage of resource(s) have taken the action. The activity waits for the actors' action until the 'Timeout for action' is reached. </p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Property Type: Optional</strong>&nbsp;(This property needs to be set only if necessary. It is useful in group response scenarios.)</p>
<p class="paragraph"></p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Min Actors Required for WorkAssignment Completion [% or Number]</strong>&nbsp;- This property specifies the minimum number of actors to act on the Work before the 'Timeout Warning for Action'. If the action limit is reached before the 'Timeout Warning for Action' then the warning message is not shown.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Property Type: Optional</strong>&nbsp;(This property needs to be set only if necessary. It is useful in group response scenarios.)</p>
<p class="paragraph"></p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Ignore Unavailable Actors?</strong>&nbsp;- If this property is set to 'No', when the Work activity is assigned to the actors list a check is first done to see whether the actor is available. If the actor is not available then a check is made for an alternate actor assigned to the unavailable actor. Simultaneously, the value of the property 'Alternate Actor Allowed' is checked. If that is also set, then the Work is assigned to this actor. </p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Property Type: Optional</strong>&nbsp;(This property needs to be set only if necessary.)</p>
<p class="paragraph"></p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Alternate Actor Allowed?</strong>&nbsp;- This property is set to assign a particular Work to an alternate actor in the absence or unavailability of any actor. </p>

<p class="paragraph"></p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Minimum available time for Activity</strong>&nbsp;- This property is used to check the availability of an actor to whom a task must be assigned while executing the activity. The availability check for the actor is done based on the Calendar settings (Global or Resource Calendar). If the time taken to complete the task is within the value set for the <b class="uicontrol">Minimum available time for Activity </b> property, then the task will be assigned to that actor. However, if the time taken to complete the task exceeds the value set for the <b class="uicontrol">Minimum available time for Activity</b> property, then the task will be assigned based on the values set for the <b class="uicontrol">Ignore Unavailable Actors?</b> and <b class="uicontrol">Alternate Actor Allowed?</b> properties. </p>

<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Timeout Warning for Ownerships</strong>&nbsp;- This property specifies the time at which a warning is provided to a actors to take ownership of the work item assigned to him/her. If the actors do not take ownership within this time the engine is notified with a warning. Thus if 'Min.Ownerships' is set, and it is not satisfied before the given time then a warning is sent. If Min.Ownerships is 0, it will check for Max.Ownerships. If the ownership count does not reach the Max.Ownerships value within the set time, a warning is sent. If both Min.Ownerships and Max.Ownerships are not set, this property is ignored. </p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Property Type: Optional&nbsp;</strong>(This property needs to be set only if necessary.)</p>
<p class="paragraph"></p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Timeout for Ownerships</strong>&nbsp;- This property specifies the time until which actors are allowed to take ownership, i.e. the time until which the Work activity will wait for actors to take ownership. If Min.Ownerships is set and is not reached, the work item is removed from all work item lists. If Min.Ownerships is 0, it will check if ownership count is less than Max.Ownerships. If it is, the work item is removed from all work item lists. Else the work item will be removed from the work item lists of those who have taken ownership. The work item will remain in the work item list of those who have taken ownership and wait for action from them.</p>

<ul class="ulitem"><li class="ulitem">Work activity is assigned to the actors in the Work assignment list by the workflow engine. Work activity has a default property set that at least one actor has to make a Take Ownership of the activity. </li><li class="ulitem">A drop down interface has been provided for the actor to Take Ownership. However, the actor can act on the Work without taking ownership first, in which case ownership will be considered to be done, i.e. if the actor acts upon the Work activity without taking ownership, then it is considered as an ownership with action taken.</li><li class="ulitem">After the actor has taken ownership, a link is provided to the actor, which opens a pop up with the details of the other actors. This is again tagged with the 'Hide Responses?' property. The link will be provided only If 'Hide Responses?' is set as 'No'. The pop up will have details like Actor name, Ownership Status, Action taken, Comments. </li><li class="ulitem">If the 'Min.Ownerships' property is set and the Ownership count has reached the set limit [percentage or number] then the 'Timeout Warning For Ownership' property is not considered. </li><li class="ulitem">If the 'Min.Ownerships' property is set and the ownership count has reached the set limit [percentage or number] and the 'Time Out For Ownership' is also reached then the work item is removed from other approvers' work item lists and the work item waits for action from those who have taken ownership. </li><li class="ulitem">If the 'Min.Ownerships' limit is not reached for the Work action, and the 'Timeout Warning For Ownership' has been exceeded then the actor is notified with a warning by including an email or an information activity, with the Timeout Warning for Ownership link to it. </li><li class="ulitem">If 'Timeout For Ownerships' is set, if the Work activity has not reached the minimum limit (Min.Ownerships) and the 'Time Out For Ownerships' has been reached, then the work item is removed from the work item lists of all the actors. </li><li class="ulitem">If 'Min.Ownerships' = 0 and if 'Max.Ownerships' is set, the activity waits for actors to take ownership or action until the 'Time Out For Ownership' is reached (if this is set). </li><li class="ulitem">If none of the Ownership properties are set then the activity waits until the actor takes ownership or acts upon it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li class="ulitem">Timeout Warning for Activity&nbsp;- This property specifies when a reminder has to be provided for the actors to act on the Work request, if the action count has not been reached. If properties such as Max.Ownerships, Affirmative Action for Work (AAA), and Action Limit (AL) are set, once the property values are reached then a warning is sent to the actor. When the timeout is reached, the following checks are made: If AL is set, when the action count i.e. the no. of Works or rejections (AC) &lt; AL, then a warning is sent. If AL = 0 and AAA is set, and when AC &lt; AAA, then a warning is sent to the participant.</li></ul><p class="paragraph"></p>

<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Timeout for Activity</strong>&nbsp;- This property's value is used to decide until what time the activity should wait for the actors' action. If properties such as Max.Ownerships, AAA, AL are set, once the property values are reached the work item is removed from the work item lists of all the actors. When the timeout is reached, the following checks are made: If AL is set, when the action count i.e. the no. of Works or rejections (AC) &lt; AL, then the timeout for action is performed and the work item is removed from all work item lists. If AC &gt; AL, it checks with the no. of Works or 'decision count' (DC) and AAA. If DC &gt;= AAA (if it is set), the activity is considered approved; otherwise, it is rejected. If AAA = 0 and if DC &gt;= AL, the action is considered completed. If AL = 0 and AC &lt; AAA, then the timeout for action is performed and the work item is removed from all work item lists. If AL = 0 and AC &gt; AAA, it will check with DC. If DC &gt; AAA it is completed. If AL = 0 and AAA = 0, then if DC is at least 1, then it is considered completed.</p>

<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Multiple TimeOut Warning</strong>&nbsp;- This is used to set recurring timeout warnings that will be sent to the actors who have to take action. To set multiple timeout warnings, click the 'Multiple TimeOut Warning' button in the Properties pane for the Work activity. A new window pops up. In this window, set the interval for the recurring warning as well as the output message. You can also set the Recurring Time Interval. This can be used to set a different recurring time out after the first timeout happens. For example, if 'Time Interval' for the property is set as 7 days and 'Recurring Time Interval' is set as 2 days, then the first time out will happen after 7 days and there will be a recurring time out every second day after the seventh day (first) time out.</p>
