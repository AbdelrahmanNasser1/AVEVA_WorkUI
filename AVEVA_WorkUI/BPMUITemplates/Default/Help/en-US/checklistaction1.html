<h3 id="t601938" class="heading3">Checklist Activity</h3>
<p class="subheading">Activity Description:</p>
<p class="paragraph">The Checklist Activity is incorporated in the AVEVA Work Tasks Workflow process design to send questions that need to be answered by actors in a workflow. These questions can be sent with a Text box, Memo, Checklist, Drop-down, or Radio Button to capture the answers provided by actors.</p>
<p class="subheading">Application Scenarios:</p>
<p class="paragraph">A typical application scenario could be a Technical Support Request Workflow Process, which will have a set of radio buttons on the Request Form which the customer can use to select the Support option applicable to him/her. A Checklist activity can be used in the workflow to display these radio buttons and retrieve the customer selection information.</p>
<p class="subheading">Workflow Variables for Checklist:</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Steps to define variables for use in the Checklist activity</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">This section describes how to define variables for use in Checklist activities. It gives the syntax for creating the variables and typical examples for different cases.</p>
<p class="subheading">Variables for capturing WorkItemIds</p>
<p class="paragraph">The Work Item Id's for the Checklist work item can be retrieved using a variable of type Array, with the following syntax:</p>
<p class="paragraph">'<strong class="strong">^'+CurrentActivity.Name+'WorkItemIds'.</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">For example, <strong class="strong">^ReviewDocumentWorkItemIds</strong>.</p>
<p class="subheading">Variables for capturing All Actors' Details</p>
<p class="paragraph">The details of the actor(s) to whom the Checklist work item gets assigned, can be accessed by declaring a variable of type array with the following syntax:</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">'^'+CurrentActivity.Name+'ActingUsers'</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">For example, <strong class="strong">^ReviewDocumentActingUsers</strong>.</p>
<p class="subheading">Variables for capturing Responding Actors' Details</p>
<p class="paragraph">The details of the actors' submitting the Checklist response, can be accessed by declaring a variable of type resource with the following syntax:</p>
<p class="paragraph">'<strong class="strong">^'+HWSActivity.ActivityName+'RespondingUser'</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">For example, <strong class="strong">^ReviewDocumentRespondingUser</strong>.</p>
<p class="paragraph">This variable stores the responded user information. If it is more than one user, it will retrieve the last user details.</p>
<p class="note"><strong class="notelabel">Note:</strong> For single user, you can declare this variable as Resource type. If task is assigned to multiple users and to get all responded users information, then the variable has to be declared as Array.</p>
<p class="subheading">Variables for capturing Comments</p>
<p class="paragraph">Comments entered in a Checklist can be retrieved using a variable with the following syntax:</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">'^'+_HWSActivity.CurrentActivity.Name+'CommentCheckList'</strong>.</p>
<p class="paragraph">For example, <strong class="strong">^ReviewDocumentCommentCheckList</strong>.</p>
<p class="paragraph">(To add a comment field to the Checklist HTML page create a Text box control in Checklist HTML pages with the name &quot;txtcomment&quot;. The HTML template pages for the Checklist activity can be found under the [AVEVA Work Tasks Installed Path]\WorkflowElements\Default\en-US\Activities\Activity folder.)</p>
<p class="subheading">Variables for capturing Checklist Questions and Answers in HTML format</p>
<p class="paragraph">Question and answers entered in the Checklist can be accessed in HTML format by using a variable with the following syntax:</p>
<p class="paragraph">'<strong class="strong">^'+CurrentActivity.Name+'AnswersHTMLCheckList'</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">For example, ^ReviewDocumentAnswersHTMLCheckList.</p>
<p class="subheading">Variables for capturing Checklist Questions and Answers in XML format</p>
<p class="paragraph">Question and answers entered in the Checklist can be accessed in XML format by using a variable with the following syntax:</p>
<p class="paragraph">'<strong class="strong">^'+ CurrentActivity.Name+'AnswersXMLCheckList'</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">For example, <strong class="strong">^ReviewDocumentAnswersXMLCheckList</strong>.</p>
<p class="subheading">Variables for assigning queue system variable</p>
<p class="paragraph">To assign queues instead of setting the queue through Assign Queue property, add a variable with a name prefixed by '^', with the following syntax:</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">&quot;^&quot;+ CurrentActivity.Name + &quot;_QueueVariable&quot;.</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">For example, if the activity name is 'Approval1' then declare the variable as ^Approval1_QueueVariable in the Start activity with the Type as String. Using the &quot;Update Variable&quot; activity, assign the queue-id (GUID) for this variable in the Workflow.</p>
<p class="paragraph">To assign multiple queues, specify the queue-ids with semicolon (;) as the separator. Skelta.HWS.Queue.QueueCollection class can be used to retrieve queue information.</p>
<p class="subheading">Variable for Queue Acting Users</p>
<p class="paragraph">You can declare an Array type variable to get updated information about the name of the actor to whom an activity gets assigned from a queue.</p>
<p class="paragraph">In the Workflow Variables, define the variable in the following format:</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">^+CurrentActivityName+'QueueActingUsers'</strong> </p>
<p class="paragraph">Ex: ^HRFormQueueActingUsers</p>
<p class="paragraph">HRForm is the activity name.</p>
<p class="paragraph">For example the value of the user who acts on the HRForm activity will be stored in the variable. The Approval1 task will be assigned to the same user.</p>
<p class="subheading">Variable for storing timeout warning value</p>
<p class="paragraph">Suppose if you want to store the timeout warning value for Checklist activity in your workflow. The naming convention for the system variable to be declared is</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">^&lt;ActivityName&gt;ResponseByWarningTimeout</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">The value returned by the variable will be in UTC format. For multiple user scenarios the highest timeout value calculated for user will be available in the variable.</p>
<p class="note"><strong class="notelabel">Note:</strong> Multiple timeout warnings cannot be tracked using this feature.</p>
<p class="subheading">Retrieving Stored Checklist Data:</p>
<p class="paragraph">When an actor has acted upon the checklist, it is marked as completed and the details are stored in XML format in the database. It can be retrieved as SELECT DATA FROM SKWorkItem SKW, SKWorkItemData SKWD WHERE</p>
<p class="paragraph">SKW.DataId = SKWD.Id AND SKW.Id = &lt;WorkItemId&gt;.</p>
<p class="paragraph">See the XML file to know how the details are stored in the database.</p>
<p class="paragraph">The following image shows the format in which the Checklist Details are stored in the XML file:</p>
