<h3 id="t613026" class="heading3">Invoke Form Activity</h3>
<p class="subheading">Activity Description:</p>
<p class="paragraph">The Invoke Form Activity is basically an activity inside workflows, wherein the workflow actually invokes the form. The invoking activity is also linked to an approval process. As an example, consider the Leave Application Form. Once an employee fills out the Leave Application Form and submits it, the associated workflow is triggered and accordingly, the Form is invoked. It is sent to the reporting manager for approval. The manager also has the option to make comments and approve/reject the submitted form.</p>
<p class="paragraph"></p>
<p class="paragraph">Collaboration Mode: The Invoke Form Activity is said to be in Collaboration mode when the &quot;Individual actor's response collaboration in Output Instance XML&quot; property is configured to collect responses from multiple users.</p>
<p class="note"><strong class="notelabel">Note:</strong> For generating possible distinct outputs, use buttons of the following <b class="uicontrol">Button Type</b>:<br>        - <b class="uicontrol">Submit</b><br>        - <b class="uicontrol">Custom </b>(used for submitting the form)</p>
<p class="paragraph"></p>
<p class="subheading">Application Scenarios:</p>
<p class="paragraph"></p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Scenario 1: Opening a different form using Invoke Form activity</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">When a new employee joins an organization, the HR Person will fill up the employee's details and submits the form. This will go to network team to create mail id and other network requirements.</p>
<p class="paragraph"></p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Scenario 2: Updating Form Parameters with Workflow Variable Values</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">When an employee submits a Leave Application form, the request will go to the Manager for approval. Manger can view the workflow variable values such as submitted user details like submitted date, user name, and user e-mail. These form parameters are updated with the workflow values while executing.</p>
<p class="paragraph"></p>
<p class="subheading">Workflow Variables for Invoke Form:</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Steps to define variables for use in the Invoke Form activity</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">This section describes how to define variables for use in Invoke Form activities. It gives the syntax for creating the variables and typical examples for different cases.</p>
<p class="paragraph"></p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Variables for capturing WorkItemIds</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">The Activity IDs for the activity can be retrieved using a variable of type array, with the following syntax:</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">'^'+CurrentActivity.Name+'WorkItemIds'</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">For example,&nbsp;^ManagerFormWorkItemIds</p>
<p class="paragraph">Where 'ManagerForm' is a activity name.</p>
<p class="paragraph"></p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Variables for capturing All Actors' Details</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">The details of the actor(s) to whom the approval work item gets assigned can be accessed by declaring a variable of type array with the following syntax:</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">'^'+CurrentActivity.Name+'ActingUsers'</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">For example,&nbsp;<strong class="strong">^ManagerFormActingUsers</strong>.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Where 'ManagerForm' is a activity name.</p>
<p class="paragraph"></p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Variables for capturing Responding Actors' Details</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">The details of the actor(s) submitting the approval/rejection response can be accessed by declaring a variable of type resource with the following syntax:</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">'^'+HWSActivity.ActivityName+'RespondingUser'</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">For example,&nbsp;^ManagerFormRespondingUser.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Where 'ManagerForm' is a activity name.</p>
<p class="paragraph">This variable stores the responded user information. If it is more than one user, it will retrieve the last user details.</p>
<p class="paragraph"></p>
<p class="note"><strong class="notelabel">Note:</strong> For single user, you can declare this variable as&nbsp;Resource&nbsp;type. If task is assigned to more than one user and to get all responded users information, then declare this variable as array.</p>
<p class="paragraph"></p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Variables for assigning queue system variable</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">To assign queues instead of setting the queue through&nbsp;Assign Queue&nbsp;property, add a variable with a name prefixed by '^', with the following syntax:</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">&nbsp;&quot;^&quot;+ CurrentActivity.Name + &quot;_QueueVariable&quot;</strong>.</p>
<p class="paragraph">For example,&nbsp;if the activity name is 'ManagerForm' then declare the variable as ^ManagerForm_QueueVariable in the&nbsp;Start&nbsp;activity with the Type as&nbsp;String. Using the &quot;Update Variable&quot; activity, assign the queue-id (GUID) for this variable in the workflow.</p>
<p class="paragraph"></p>
<p class="paragraph">To assign multiple queues, specify the queue-ids with semicolon (;)&nbsp;separator.&nbsp;Skelta.HWS.Queue.QueueCollection&nbsp;class can be used to retrieve queue information.</p>
<p class="paragraph"></p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Variable for Queue Acting Users</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">You can declare an array type variable to get updated information about the name of the actor to whom an activity gets assigned from a queue.</p>
<p class="paragraph">In the Workflow Variables, define the variable in the following format:</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">^+CurrentActivityName+'QueueActingUsers</strong>' </p>
<p class="paragraph">Example: <strong class="strong">^HRFormQueueActingUsers</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">HRForm is the activity name.</p>
<p class="paragraph">For example the value of the user who acts on the HRForm activity will be stored in the variable. The Approval1 task will be assigned to the same user.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><br></p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Variable for storing timeout warning value</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">Suppose if you want to store the timeout warning value for Invoke Form activity in your workflow. The naming convention for the system variable to be&nbsp;declared is</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">^&lt;ActivityName&gt;ResponseByWarningTimeout</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">The value returned by the variable will be in UTC format. For multiple user&nbsp;scenarios the highest timeout value calculated for a user will be available in the variable.</p>
<p class="paragraph"></p>

<p class="paragraph"><br></p>
<p class="subheading">Actors</p>
<p class="paragraph">The properties in the Actors group have been described below. You can use these properties to specify the actors who will work on the activity and related properties.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><br></p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Assign Actor(s)</strong>&nbsp;- This property is used to specify the actor(s) who has to take up the Invoke Form activity. It is tagged with the Ignore Unavailable Actors property which in turn is tagged with the Alternate Actor Allowed property. This will be explained in detail later.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Property Type: Mandatory</strong>&nbsp;(This property must be set if the activity is to be assigned to any actor(s).)</p>

<p class="paragraph"><br></p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Min. Ownerships [% or Number]</strong>&nbsp;- This property, which can be specified as a number or percentage, is the minimum number of actors who should take ownership of the Approval request. This property is related to the 'Timeout warning for Ownership' and 'Timeout for Ownership' properties. To illustrate, when 'Timeout for Ownership' is reached, the activity first checks if the ownership count is less than Min.Ownerships (if it is set). If it is, the work item will be removed from all Work Item lists. If the 'Min.Ownerships' has already been satisfied, then the work item will be removed from the Work Item lists of those who have not taken ownership. If the Min.Ownerships value is 0, then the activity checks if the ownership count is less than Max.Ownerships (if it is set). If it is, the work item will be removed from all Work Item lists. Else the work item will be removed from the Work Item lists of those who have not taken ownership. If both Min.Ownerships and Max.Ownerships are set to 0, then there should be at least one actor taking ownership within the set time, otherwise the work item will be removed from all Work Item lists.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Property Type: Optional</strong>&nbsp;(This property needs to be set only if necessary. It is useful in group response scenarios.)</p>
<p class="paragraph"><br></p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Max. Ownerships [% or Number]</strong>&nbsp;- This property (referred to as Max.Ack), which can be specified as a number or percentage, is the maximum number of actors who should take ownership of the Approval request. If 'Timeout for Ownership' is specified and achieved, and the 'Min.Ownerships' is also satisfied, then the activity waits for action from those who have taken ownership. If the Min.Ownerships value is set to 0, then it checks if the ownership count is less than Max.Ownerships. If it is, the work item will be removed from all Work Item lists. Else the work item will be removed from the Work Item lists of those who have not taken ownership. If both Min.Ownerships and Max.Ownerships are set to 0, then there should be at least one actor taking ownership within the set time, otherwise the work item will be removed from all Work Item lists.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Property Type: Optional&nbsp;</strong>(This property needs to be set only if necessary. It is useful in group response scenarios.)</p>
<p class="paragraph"><br></p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Enable Take Ownership?</strong>&nbsp;- If this property is set to&nbsp;Yes, then the actor is provided with a&nbsp;Take Ownership&nbsp;option in the Work items list to take ownership of the task. If you are not required&nbsp;Take Ownership&nbsp;option in the Work items list, then set this property as&nbsp;No.</p>
<p class="paragraph"></p>
<p class="note"><strong class="notelabel">Note:</strong> By default, this property is set as&nbsp;No.</p>
<p class="paragraph"></p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Property Type: Optional</strong>&nbsp;(This property needs to be set only if necessary.)</p>
<p class="paragraph"><br></p>
<p class="paragraph">Steps to set the Enable Take Ownership? property</p>
<p class="paragraph"></p>
<ol class="step"><li class="step">Select Yes or No option from the Enable Take Ownership? drop-down list.</li></ol><p class="paragraph"></p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Re-Assign Allowed?</strong>&nbsp;- If this property is set then the actor is provided with a Re-Assign option. Using this the approver can re-assign the work item to another resource.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Property Type: Optional</strong>&nbsp;(This property needs to be set only if necessary.)</p>
<p class="paragraph"><br></p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Ignore Unavailable Actors?</strong>&nbsp;- This property provides the following options -&nbsp;Yes,&nbsp;Yes - holidays excluded&nbsp;and&nbsp;No. If this property is set to 'No', when the Approval activity is assigned to the actor's Work items list, a check is first done to see whether the actor is available. If the actor is not available then a check is made for an alternate actor assigned to the unavailable actor. Simultaneously the value of the property 'Alternate Actor Allowed' is checked. If that is also set, then the Approval work item is assigned to this actor. &nbsp; If this property is set to&nbsp;Yes - holidays excluded,&nbsp;the workflow engine will ignore the fact that actors are not available if the day is an organization holiday and the output Not Enough Resources will not be generated. </p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Property Type: Optional&nbsp;</strong>(This property needs to be set only if necessary.)</p>
<p class="paragraph"><br></p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Alternate Actor Allowed?</strong>&nbsp;- This property is set to assign a particular task to an alternate actor in the absence or unavailability of any actor.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Property Type: Optional&nbsp;</strong>(This property needs to be set only if necessary.)</p>
<p class="paragraph"><br></p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Form Information </strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">The properties in the Form Information group have been described below. You can use these properties to specify the form details and update the form parameters.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><br></p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Form Name&nbsp;</strong>- This property is used to select form details, by selecting the form name and version.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Or</p>
<p class="paragraph">Use&nbsp;<strong class="strong">Expression Editor</strong>&nbsp;to build the expression to get the form name. This is useful if you do not know the values of the properties at the time of designing the form.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Syntax for&nbsp;<b class="uicontrol">Expression Editor</b>&nbsp;is</p>
<p class="paragraph">&nbsp;&quot;{FormGuId,Form version}Form Name&quot; where {FormGuId,Form version} is optional</p>

<p class="paragraph"><br></p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Input Instance XM</strong>L&nbsp;- &nbsp;This property is used to display the data in the Forms which is being used in the Invoke Form activity. When the user views this Form in the work item, the data available in the selected Input Instance XML variable will be displayed, &nbsp;provided the form has the same schema of the selected XML Variable.</p>
<p class="paragraph">or</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Use&nbsp;Expression Editor</strong>&nbsp;to build the expression to get the XML Variable name. This is useful if you do not know the values of the properties at the time of designing the form.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Property Type: Optional&nbsp;</strong>(This property needs to be set only if necessary.)</p>
<p class="paragraph"><br></p>
<p class="paragraph">For instance:</p>
<ol class="olitem"><li class="olitem">To show a blank form as part of the Invoke Form activity, do not select an Input Instance XML from the Input Instance XML drop-down list.

<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Update form parameters</strong>&nbsp;- This property is used to update the form parameter details.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Property Type: Optional</strong>&nbsp;(This property needs to be set only if necessary.)</p>
<p class="paragraph"></p>
<p class="note"><strong class="notelabel">Note:</strong> It is important to first select a form. For more information on selecting a form, click Steps to set the Form Name property. Once you select a form, perform the following steps to update the form parameters.</p>
<p class="paragraph"></p>
<p class="paragraph">Steps to set the Update form parameters property</p>
<p class="paragraph"></p>
<p class="paragraph">A parameter represents a value that is passed to a variable. The parameter value is defined when the variable is declared in the procedure. A procedure can be defined with no parameters, one parameter, or more than one. The part of the procedure definition that specifies the parameters is called the parameter list.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Here, parameters represent the form variables where the user can define while designing the form. These parameters can be used in Forms scripts, in user look up controls to build the filter expression, and as a parameter for the lookup query.</p>
<p class="paragraph"></p>
<p class="note"><strong class="notelabel">Note:</strong>&nbsp;Form parameters values are not stored either in form definition or in database. These values are rendered when the form is rendered.</p>
<p class="paragraph"></p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">How to define parameters:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;To work with parameters, the form should have parameters defined. To define the form parameter, on the corresponding&nbsp;Forms Designer&nbsp;screen, click&nbsp;Edit properties of the form&nbsp;&nbsp;on the top. Click the&nbsp;Advanced&nbsp;tab. You can define the parameter in the&nbsp;Form Properties&nbsp;&nbsp;section. You can define the parameter clicking the&nbsp;Add Row.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">How Form parameters can be used?</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">Form parameter can be used in Form scripts, in user look up controls to build the filter expression, and as a parameter for the lookup query. Below is the sample scenario for how parameters can be used in form scripts.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Suppose in our form we have two controls Employee id &amp; Manager Name. Based on the Employee id entered, we can populate the Manager name. To achieve this, we need to write the script (C#) to update the Manager name value from Form parameters. This parameter value can be updated from workflow.</p>

<p class="paragraph">This property enables you to specify the form which needs to be opened when multiple Invoke form work items are selected for processing. This also enables you to select multiple work items related to Invoke Form Activity and act on them from the Work items list or Inbox. The form selected opens on selection of a Work Item or multiple Work Items. On submission, the content gets updated for all the workflow instances.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><br></p>
<p class="paragraph">You need to make sure that the &nbsp;form used for multi-select has the same XML node structure as used for Output Instance XML property. This ensures that the inputs provided in the form get updated to the respective workflow instances output instance XML nodes. Upon this, the update to output instance XML &nbsp;depends on Update output instance XML only for completion maker outputs configured for Possible Distinct Outputs property. Moreover, the behavior is overridden with copying only specific node, when the Invoke form activity is to be used in response collaboration mode .</p>
<p class="paragraph"></p>
<p class="note"><strong class="notelabel">Note:</strong>In the multi-select scenario, the inputs given to the form from the workflow using Input Instance XML property will not be populated when the form is opened.</p>

<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Timeout Warning for Activity</strong>&nbsp;- This property specifies the time at which a warning is provided to an actor to take ownership of the work item assigned to him/her. If the actor does not take ownership within this time, the engine is notified with a warning. Thus if 'Min.Ownerships' is set, and it is not satisfied before the given time then a warning is sent. If Min.Ownerships is 0, it will check for Max.Ownerships. If the ownership count does not reach the Max.Ownerships value within the set time, a warning is sent. If both Min.Ownerships and Max.Ownerships are not set, this property is ignored.</p>

<p class="paragraph"><br></p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Timeout for Activity</strong>&nbsp;- This property's value is used to decide until what time the work item should wait for user action. If properties such as Max.Ownerships, AAA, AL are set, once the property values are reached the work item is removed from the Work Item lists of all the approvers. When the timeout is reached, the following checks are made: If AL is set, when the activity count i.e. the no. of approvals or rejections (AC) &lt; AL, then the timeout for activity is performed and the activity is removed from all Work Item lists. If AC &gt; AL, it checks with the no. of approvals or 'decision count' (DC) and AAA. If DC &gt;= AAA (if it is set), the work item is considered approved; otherwise, it is rejected. If AAA = 0 and if DC &gt;= AL, the work item is considered approved; otherwise, it is rejected. If AL = 0 and AC &lt; AAA, then the timeout for activity is performed and the work item is removed from all Work Item lists. If AL = 0 and AC &gt; AAA, it will check with DC. If DC &gt; AAA it is approved; otherwise, it is rejected. If AL = 0 and AAA = 0, then if DC is at least 1, then it is considered approved; otherwise, it is rejected.</p>

<p class="paragraph"><br></p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Multiple TimeOut Warning</strong>&nbsp;- This is used to set recurring timeout warnings that will be sent to the actors who have to take action. To set multiple timeout warnings, click the 'Multiple TimeOut Warning' button in the Properties pane for the Approval activity. A new window pops up. In this window, set the interval for the recurring warning as well as the output message. You can also set the Recurring Time Interval. This can be used to set a different recurring time out after the first timeout happens. For example, if 'Time Interval' for the property is set as 7 days and 'Recurring Time Interval' is set as 2 days, then the first time out will happen after 7 days and there will be a recurring time out every second day after the seventh day (first) time out.</p>

<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Responses and Outputs</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph">The properties in the Responses and Outputs group have been described below. You can use this property to specify the responses and outputs of the activity.</p>
<p class="paragraph"></p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Output Instance XML</strong> - This property is used to get the data from the Forms which the user has edited from the Work item page. Depending on the type of XML variable selected in this property, the XML data is stored, provided the output instance XML has the same schema of the Form.</p>
<p class="paragraph">or</p>
<p class="paragraph">Use<b class="uicontrol"> Expression Editor</b> to build the expression to get the XML Variable name. This is useful if you do not know the values of the properties at the time of designing the form.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><strong class="strong">Property Type: Mandatory</strong> (This property must be set in order to use the data entered by the user in the workflow)</p>
<p class="paragraph"></p>
<p class="paragraph">For instance:</p>
<ol class="step"><li class="step">If the Output Instance XML is of type XML List , then the XML data received from the Form is stored in the respective List depending on the list item scope defined for the XML Variable.<ol class="substep"><li class="substep">The list item scope should be New , if a new list item to be added with the Form data in list.</li><li class="substep">The list item scope should be Current, if the list item that initiated the workflow has to be updated.</li><li class="substep">The list item scope should be List Query, if a specific list item to be updated in the list.</li></ol></li><li class="step">If the Output Instance XML is of type XML Document, then the XML data received is stored in the workflow itself.</li></ol><p class="paragraph">Display an existing list item data using&nbsp;Invoke Form&nbsp;and then store the updated Form data in a different list (destination list): An intermediate XML Variable is required for such scenarios. Use an&nbsp;Update Variable&nbsp;activity before the&nbsp;Invoke Form&nbsp;activity, to assign the Source list XML values to the Intermediate XML Variable, Then use this intermediate XML variable as&nbsp;Input Instance XML&nbsp;and destination XML List as&nbsp;Output Instance XML.</p>
<p class="note"><strong class="notelabel">Note:</strong> Source, destination list, and Intermediate XML variable should have the same schema.</p>
